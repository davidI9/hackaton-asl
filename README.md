Hi there, this is a brief proyect thet me and some partners did in our experience in ASL's 2024 Hackaton.
It is based on python and developed using a library named PIL. This code offers some basic and funny interactions with images.
You can upload both an image's url or files from your computer (urls are having a rough time in this implementation :) ).

The main file is carlos.py, its just carlos :D
